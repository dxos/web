# Full-stack Tutorial

Get involved by creating a frame that can be deployed to our network. It will allow you to quick use all our stack.

## Install CLI

```
yarn add global @dxos/cli
```

## Install Devtools
Our tool to debug what's happening under the hood. <a href="https://github.com/dxos/protocols/blob/main/packages/devtools/devtools-extension/README.md" target="_blank">Follow this instructions</a>

<!--
Could we use the dx CLI to download the artifact and then lead to Google Extension guide?
Something like:
```
dx devtools download

# DONE - Please follow this guide to add it as extension to Chrome: https://webkul.com/blog/how-to-install-the-unpacked-extension-in-chrome/
# DONE - Please follow this guide to add it as extension to Firefox: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension#installing
```

## Create a frame

### What's a frame?
A frame is a javascript module which can be remotely loaded and included in another app.<br/>
It primary consists of a React component plus some additional metadata.

### Creation

Create a frame based on the frame-template repo:
```
dx app create --template https://github.com/dxos/frame-template/tree/master --path ./test-frame
```

### Installation
```
cd ./test-frame
yarn
```

### Run the frame locally

```
yarn book
```

Great! Now you have a basic frame up and running.
Let's create a To Do list using our stack now.

## Deploy the frame

Requirements:
- <a href="/docs/ref-cli/installation" target="_blank">Create your profile</a>
- <a href="/docs/ref-cli/profile-keys-setup" target="_blank">Set up your profile keys</a>
- <a href="/docs/ref-cli/profile-authority" target="_blank">Claim your profile authority</a>

To deploy frames we need a number of steps:

- build: This generates the ditribution files along with configuration specific for the given `app.yml`
- publish: Upload the dist folder to IPFS. Update the hash in the `app.yml`
- register: Use `app.yml` to generate a record in DXNS.

All this operations can be resumed with one command:

```
dx app deploy --domain "test" --name "frame.example"
```

## Run the frame in Braneframe
