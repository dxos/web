# Account Setup

TODO: Update based on https://github.com/dxos/protocols/issues/860.

We're going to setup a DXNS developer account and register a domain. This will require your [development environment to be setup](./dev-environment), so you need to complete that first if you skipped it.

## Create Developer Account

Once you have setup a profile you can then create a developer account on the DXNS registry:

```bash
dx dxns account generate
```

After running this you will see the following output with a unique address and seed phrase:

```bash
key       value
--------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
mnemonic  eyebrow dust cry stove someone remind insane talk health slight swarm yellow
address   5EpqhyY9AfHgmrqwFs7tFh3V89ktNamgTP3TWM5zgeQM8y7a
```

In order to finish setting up your profile, copy the mnemonic and add it to your current profile. You can find your profile file in `~/.dx/profile/enterprise.yml`. Enter the mnemonic in the field `runtime.services.dxns.accountUri`.

## Fund Account

We will now add funds to your registry account so that you can purchase a domain. In order to do this you need the address of a faucet and an account address. You can find the address of your faucet in your profile config file, while your account address is taken from the output when you generated your account.

```bash
dx dxns balance increase --faucet https://dxns2.kube.dxos.network/kube/faucet --account 5EpqhyY9AfHgmrqwFs7tFh3V89ktNamgTP3TWM5zgeQM8y7a
```

You can check that your account has a balance by running the following command:

```bash
dx dxns balance get 5EpqhyY9AfHgmrqwFs7tFh3V89ktNamgTP3TWM5zgeQM8y7a
```

When you run that should see an output of:

```bash
key      value
-------  -------------
balance  1000000000000
```

## Domain

Now that you have funds in your account you'll be able to create domains in the registry. All records registered in the registry are created under a domain.

In order to registry a domain on DXNS you need to create an auction for it. [Why do I need to do this?]

```bash
dx dxns auction create my-domain 1000000
```

After some time (approximately 10 minutes), you should be able to close the auction and claim that domain, assuming no one else has outbid you:

```bash
dx dxns auction close my-domain
dx dxns auction claim my-domain
```

It should prompt out a domain key:

```bash
key        value
---------  ----------------------------------------------------------------
domainKey  aaaaaaaaa0258fbf170edb873da49c9bd79fa258fa69abef5e8c55bcc020088e
```

While you are waiting for your auction to be able to be closed, we'll move on and circle back to this later.
